# Waterford Greenway

A redesign of the website for the recently opened Waterford Greenway.

The Greenway's current website (owned and operated by Waterford City and County Council) can be viewed [here](http://www.visitwaterfordgreenway.com/)


## Qualification
I do not own copyright for these images, and this is an exercise purely for educational purposes. Do not reproduce.


## Getting Started
This project does not need any installation. A live demo is being hosted on [Heroku](https://com-waterford-greenway.herokuapp.com/index.html).


## Built With

- [ThemeForest - Canvas Theme](https://themeforest.net/item/canvas-the-multipurpose-html5-template/9228123)
- [ElevateZoom](http://www.elevateweb.co.uk/image-zoom) - A Jquery Image Zoom Plugin
- Photoshop - Lots and lots of Photoshop


## Testing
Manual testing was undertaken for every feature of the website and satisfactorily passed.

Each page was tested in various devices, screen sizes, and browsers.

A/B testing was undertaken for a number of design questions with a number of people.


## Responsiveness
Has been tested across multiple devices and browsers. Have yet to come across any undersired responsiveness issues.
Chrome Inspector responsiveness tool is buggy and does not render the site as it does in real life tests.
